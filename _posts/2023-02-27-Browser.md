### 1. [What happens when you type a URL into your browser?](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/what-happens-when-you-type-a-url?s=r)

> The diagram below illustrates the steps.

**1. Bob enters a URL into the browser and hits Enter.** 
> In this example, the URL is composed of 4 parts:
> - scheme - http://. This tells the browser to send a connection to the server using HTTP.
> - domain - example.com. This is the domain name of the site.
> - path - product/electric. It is the path on the server to the requested resource: phone.
> - resource - phone. It is the name of the resource Bob wants to visit.

**2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain with a domain name system (DNS) lookup.**
> To make the lookup process fast, data is cached at different layers: browser cache, OS cache, local network cache, and ISP cache. 
>
> 2.1 If the IP address cannot be found at any of the caches, the browser goes to DNS servers to do a recursive DNS lookup until the IP address is found(this will be covered in another post).

**3. Now that we have the IP address of the server, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the server.**

**4. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.** 
> The request looks like this:
```
𝘎𝘌𝘛 /𝘱𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1
𝘏𝘰𝘴𝘵: 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦.𝘤𝘰𝘮
```

**5. The server processes the request and sends back the response.** 
> For a successful response (the status code is 200). The HTML response might look like this: 
> ```
> 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1 200 𝘖𝘒
> 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘦: 𝘚𝘶𝘯, 30 𝘑𝘢𝘯 2022 00:01:01 𝘎𝘔𝘛
> 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦𝘳: 𝘈𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦
> 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵-𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦: 𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵/𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭; 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘵=𝘶𝘵𝘧-8
> 
> <!𝘋𝘖𝘊𝘛𝘠𝘗𝘌 𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭>
> <𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨="𝘦𝘯">
> 𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥
> </𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭>
> ```

**6. The browser renders the HTML content.**

### 2. [How does the browser render a web page?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1534201585663741953)

![How does the browser render a web page](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUqUJZFUcAEapPr?format=jpg&name=medium)

**1. Parse HTML and generate Document Object Model (DOM) tree.**
> When the browser receives the HTML data from the server, it immediately parses it and converts it into a DOM tree.

**2. Parse CSS and generate CSSOM tree.**
> The styles (CSS files) are loaded and parsed to the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).

**3. Combine DOM tree and CSSOM tree to construct the Render Tree.**
> The render tree maps all DOM structures except invisible elements (such as <head> or tags with display:none; ). In other words, the render tree is a visual representation of the DOM.

**4. Layout.**
> The content in each element of the rendering tree will be calculated to get the geometric information (position, size), which is called layout.

**5. Painting.**
> After the layout is complete, the rendering tree is transformed into the actual content on the screen. This step is called painting. The browser gets the absolute pixels of the content.

**6. Display.**
> Finally, the browser sends the absolute pixels to the GPU and displays them on the page.

### 3. [How does webassembly work?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1613577821083013121)

> What is 𝐰𝐞𝐛 𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐥𝐲 (WASM)? Why does it attract so much attention?
>
> The diagram shows how we can run native C/C++/Rust code inside a web browser with WASM.

![How does webassembly work](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmSUeRIagAA6Xde?format=jpg&name=medium)

- Traditionally, we can only work with Javascript in the web browser, and the performance cannot compare with native code like C/C++ because it is interpreted.

- However, with WASM, we can 𝐫𝐞𝐮𝐬𝐞 existing native code libraries developed in C/C++/Rust, etc, to run in the web browser. These web applications have near-native performance.
> For example, we can run the web browser's video encoding/decoding library (written in C++).

- This opens a lot of possibilities for cloud computing and 𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠. We can run serverless applications with fewer resources and instant startup time.
