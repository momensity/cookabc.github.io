### 1. [What is CDN?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1574426102256218112)

- A CDN refers to geographically distributed servers (edge servers) that provide fast delivery of 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭.

- With CDN, users don’t need to retrieve content (music, video, files, pictures, etc.) from the origin server. Instead, the content is cached at CDN nodes around the globe, and users can retrieve the content from nearby CDN nodes.

- The benefits of CDN are:
1. Improving latency
2. Reducing bandwidth
3. Improving website security, especially protecting against DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack
4. Increasing content availability

### 2. [How does CDN work?](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-does-cdn-work?s=r)

1. User types in www.myshop.com in the browser. The browser looks up the domain name in the local DNS cache.

2. If the domain name does not exist in the local DNS cache, the browser goes to the DNS resolver to resolve the name. The DNS resolver usually sits in the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

3. The DNS resolver recursively resolves the domain name (see my previous post for details). Finally, it asks the authoritative name server to resolve the domain name. 

4. If we don’t use CDN, the authoritative name server returns the IP address for www.myshop.com. But with CDN, the authoritative name server has an alias pointing to www.myshop.cdn.com (the domain name of the CDN server).

5. The DNS resolver asks the authoritative name server to resolve www.myshop.cdn.com.

6. The authoritative name server returns the domain name for the load balancer of CDN www.myshop.lb.com.

7. The DNS resolver asks the CDN load balancer to resolve www.myshop.lb.com. The load balancer chooses an optimal CDN edge server based on the user’s IP address, user’s ISP, the content requested, and the server load.

8. The CDN load balancer returns the CDN edge server’s IP address for www.myshop.lb.com.

9. Now we finally get the actual IP address to visit. The DNS resolver returns the IP address to the browser.    

10. The browser visits the CDN edge server to load the content. There are two types of contents cached on the CDN servers: static contents and dynamic contents. The former contains static pages, pictures, videos; the latter one includes results of edge computing.

11. If the edge CDN server cache doesn't contain the content, it goes upward to the regional CDN server. If the content is still not found, it will go upward to the central CDN server, or even go to the origin - the London web server. This is called the CDN distribution network, where the servers are deployed geographically.
