> TPUs are only effective for large Deep Learning models and long model training time (weeks or months) that require ONLY matrix multiplications

***1. The concepts.***
> - A 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 is an executable file containing a set of instructions and passively stored on disk. One program can have multiple processes. For example, the Chrome browser creates a different process for every single tab.
> - A 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 means a program is in execution. When a program is loaded into the memory and becomes active, the program becomes a process. The process requires some essential resources such as registers, program counter, and stack.
> - A 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 is the smallest unit of execution within a process. 

***2. The relationship between program, process, and thread.***
> - The program contains a set of instructions.
> - The program is loaded into memory. It becomes one or more running processes.
> - When a process starts, it is assigned memory and resources. A process can have one or more threads. 

***3. The main differences between process and thread.***
> - Processes are usually independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process.
> - Each process has its own memory space. Threads that belong to the same process share the same memory.
> - A process is a heavyweight operation. It takes more time to create and terminate.
> - Context switching is more expensive between processes.
> - Inter-thread communication is faster for threads.

### 3. [Linux file descriptors](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1553033011016306689)

> A file descriptor represents an open file. It is a unique number assigned by the operating system to each file. It is an 𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 for working with files. We need to use file descriptors to read from or write to files in our program.
> Each process maintains its own file descriptor table.

> How do we interact with Linux Filesystem via 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬?
> The diagram below shows the layered architecture in Linux filesystem. Let’s take process 1234 as an example.

![Linux file descriptors](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY17SfJUcAYVmeV?format=jpg&name=large)

#### 1. In User Space

> When we open a file called “fileA.txt” in Process 1234, we get file descriptor fd1, which is equal to 3. We can then pass the file descriptor to other functions, to write data to the file.

#### 2. In Kernel Space

> - In Linux kernel, there is a 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 to maintain the data for the processes. Each process has an entry in the table. Each process maintains a file descriptor table, with file descriptors as its indices.
> - Notice that file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are reserved in each file descriptor table to represent stdin, stdout and stderr.
> - The file pointer points to an entry in the 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞, which has information about open files across all processes. Multiple file descriptors can point to the same file table entry. For example, file descriptor 0,1 and 2 point to the same open file table entry.
> - Since different open file table entries can represent the same file, it is a waste of resources to store the file static information so many times. We need another abstraction layer called ‘vnode table’ to store the static data.
> - In each file table entry, there is a vnode pointer, which points to an entry in 𝐯𝐧𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞. The static information includes file type, function pointers, reference counts, inode etc. inode describes a physical object in the filesystem.

#### 3. In Filesystem

> The inode array element stores the actual file information, including permission mode, owners, timestamps, etc. inode also points to the data blocks stored in the filesystem.

### 4. [Linux file permission](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1532026886359879681)

> Linux file permission illustrated.

To understand Linux file permissions, we need to understand Ownership and Permission.

***𝐎𝐰𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩***
> - Owner: the owner is the user who created the file or directory
> - Group: a group can have multiple users. All users in the group have the same permissions to access the file or directory
> - Other: other means those who are not owners or members of the group

***𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧***
> - Read (r): the read permission allows the user to read a file.
> - Write (w): the write permission allows the user to change the content of the file.
> - Execute (x): the execute permission allows a file to be executed.
