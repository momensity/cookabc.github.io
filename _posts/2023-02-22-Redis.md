### 1. [Why is Redis so fast?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1622999903894110214)

> The diagram below shows 3 main reasons:

1. Redis is RAM-based. 
> - Access to RAM is at least 1000 times faster than access to random disks. 
> - Redis can be used as a cache to improve application responsiveness and reduce database load.
2. Redis implements IO multiplexing and single-threaded execution.
3. Several efficient lower-level data structures are leveraged by Redis. 
> - By keeping these data structures in memory, serialization and deserialization costs are reduced.
> - SortedSet, for example, makes the implementation of leaderboards so simple and efficient.
> - On the other hand, a bitmap can be used to aggregate month-over-month login statuses.

### 2. [How do big keys impact Redis persistence?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1571880260177907713)

> We call a key that contains a large size of data a big key. For example, the size of the key is 5 MB.

How does Redis persist data?
> 1. First writes keys into memory.
> 2. Then calls write() to write the data into the kernel buffer cache. 
> 3. Then calls fsync() to flush all modified in-core data of the file to the disk device.

There are three modes when we turn on AOF persistence:
> 1. Always - calls fsync() synchronously. If we need to update a big key, the main thread will be blocked because it has to wait for the write to complete.
> 2. EverySec - starts a background timer task to call fsync() every second, so big keys have no impact on the Redis main thread.
> 3. No - never calls fsync(). Instead, the operating system decides when the data is written to the disk. Big keys have no impact on the main thread.

### 3. [Redis use cases](https://twitter.com/sahnlam/status/1620300880993189889)

> Here are my top 5 use cases where it shines:

![Redis use cases](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fnx3DxwakAEYsG0?format=jpg&name=large)

1. Caching
> The most common use case is to utilize Redis for caching objects or pages. This helps protect the database layer from overloading.
2. Session
> We use Redis to share user session data among stateless servers.
3. Distributed lock
> We use Redis distributed locks to grant mutually exclusive access to shared resources.
4. Counter and Rate Limiter
> These two use cases are related: 
> We use Redis to track like counts on social media apps, and also to enforce rate limits on our endpoints.
5. Leaderboard
> Sorted Sets is a delightful way to implement a gaming leaderboard.

### 4. [Redis vs Memcached](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/redis-vs-memcached?s=r)

> What are the differences between Redis and Memcached? The diagram below illustrates the key differences.

The advantages of data structures make Redis a good choice for:
> - Recording the number of clicks and comments for each post (hash)
> - Sorting the commented user list and deduping the users (zset)
> - Caching user behavior history and filtering malicious behaviors (zset, hash)
> - Storing boolean information of extremely large data into small space. For example, login status, membership status. (bitmap)
