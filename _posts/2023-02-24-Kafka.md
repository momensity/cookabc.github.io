### 1. [Why Kafka is fast?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1506663791961919488)

> Kafka achieves low latency message delivery through Sequential I/O and Zero Copy Principle. The same techniques are commonly used in many other messaging/streaming platforms.
> 
> The diagram below illustrates how the data is transmitted between producer and consumer, and what zero-copy means.

ðŸ”¹Step 1.1 - 1.3: Producer writes data to the disk 
 
ðŸ”¹Step 2: Consumer reads data without zero-copy
- 2.1: The data is loaded from disk to OS cache
- 2.2 The data is copied from OS cache to Kafka application
- 2.3 Kafka application copies the data into the socket buffer 
- 2.4 The data is copied from socket buffer to network card
- 2.5 The network card sends data out to the consumer

ðŸ”¹Step 3: Consumer reads data with zero-copy
- 3.1: The data is loaded from disk to OS cache
- 3.2 OS cache directly copies the data to the network card via sendfile() command
- 3.3 The network card sends data out to the consumer

> Zero copy is a shortcut to save the multiple data copies between application context and kernel context. This approach brings down the time by â€‹â€‹approximately 65%.
