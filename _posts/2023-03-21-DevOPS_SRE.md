**1. DevOps** as a concept was introduced in 2009 by Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer at the Agile conference.

> They sought to bridge the gap between software development and operations by promoting a collaborative culture and shared responsibility for the entire software development lifecycle.

**2.SRE, or Site Reliability Engineering** was pioneered by Google in the early 2000s to address operational challenges in managing large-scale, complex systems.

> Google developed SRE practices and tools, such as the Borg cluster management system and the Monarch monitoring system, to improve the reliability and efficiency of their services.

**3. Platform Engineering** is a more recent concept, building on the foundation of SRE engineering.

> The precise origins of Platform Engineering are less clear, but it is generally understood to be an extension of the DevOps and SRE practices, with a focus on delivering a comprehensive platform for product development that supports the entire business perspective.
