### 1. [How does ChatGPT work?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1620463186460971008)

> We attempted to explain how it works in the diagram below. 
> The process can be broken down into two parts.

**1. Training**. To train a ChatGPT model, there are two stages:
- Pre-training: In this stage, we train a GPT model (decoder-only transformer) on a large chunk of internet data.
> The objective is to train a model that can predict future words given a sentence in a way that is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
>
> After the pre-training stage, the model can complete given sentences, but it is not capable of responding to questions.
- Fine-tuning: This stage is a 3-step process that turns the pre-trained model into a question-answering ChatGPT model:
> 1). Collect training data that comprise (questions and answers), and fine-tune the pre-trained model on this data. The model takes a question as input and learns to generate an answer similar to the training data.
>
> 2). Collect more data that comprise (question, several answers) and train a reward model to rank these answers from most relevant to least relevant.
>
> 3). Use reinforcement learning (PPO optimization) to fine-tune the model, so the model's answers are more accurate.

**2. Answer a prompt**.
- Step 1: The user enters the full question.
- Step 2: The question is sent to a content moderation component. This component ensures that the question does not violate safety guidelines and filters inappropriate questions.
- Steps 3-4: If the input passes content moderation, it is sent to the chatGPT model. If the input doesn’t pass content moderation, it goes straight to template response generation.
- Step 5-6: Once the model generates the response, it is sent to a content moderation component again. This ensures the generated response is safe, harmless, unbiased, etc.
- Step 7: If the input passes content moderation, it is shown to the user. If the input doesn’t pass content moderation, it goes to template response generation and shows a template answer to the user.

### 2. [How are AI writers different?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1624087065095991296)

> ChatGPT, Jasper AI, copy ai… How are AI writers different?
> The diagram below shows how we can use popular AI writers.

In general, the tools cover the workflow of copywriting and content creation. They can choose topics, write content and optimize the content.
- For example, we can first use SurferSEO to extract keywords and topics and then use Jasper or writesonic to generate marketing content.
- If we want to customize the tone for different audiences, we can use wordtune to paraphrase the articles.
