- Step 1: Alice logs in to the chat application and establishes a web socket connection with the server side.

- Steps 2-4: The presence service receives Alice's notification, updates her presence, and notifies Alice's friends about her presence.

- Steps 1-2: Alice sends a chat message to Bob. The chat message is routed to Chat Service A.

- Steps 3-4: The chat message is sent to the sequencing service which generates a unique ID, and is persisted in the message store.

- Step 5: The chat message is sent to the message sync queue to sync to Bob’s chat service.

- Step 6: Before forwarding the messaging, the message sync service checks Bob’s presence:
    
    - a. If Bob is online, the chat message is sent to chat service B.
    - b. If Bob is offline, the message is sent to the push server and gets pushed to Bob’s device.

- Steps 7-8: If Bob is online, the chat message is pushed to Bob via the web socket.
