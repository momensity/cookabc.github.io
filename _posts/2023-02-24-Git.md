### 1. [How does Git Work?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1609953957174218754)

> Git is a distributed version control system.
> Every developer maintains a local copy of the main repository and edits and commits to the local copy. 
> The commit is very fast because the operation doesn’t interact with the remote repository. 
> If the remote repository crashes, the files can be recovered from the local repositories.

### 2. [Git Workflow & Immutability](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1622637514833166336)

> Immutability here means that once data is written into Git, it cannot be changed. Modifications only create new data versions. The old data remains unchanged.
>
> Immutable system designs are commonly used in systems that require high levels of auditability, such as financial systems and version control systems.

**Here's how it's used in Git design:**
1. Users' local Git storage consists of three sections: working copy, staging area, and local repository.
2. Working copies contain the files you are currently working on. The data is mutable, so you can do whatever you want with it
3. When you type "git add", your files will be added to the staging area. These files are now immutable. It is no longer possible to edit them
4. When you type "git commit", your staging files are added to the local repository. Local repository is a tree version of the append-only write-ahead log (WAL). They are both immutable: you can only append to the end of the data structure.
5. When you type "git push", your local repository data will be synced to the remote repository. As the remote repository uses the same data structure as your local repository, it is also immutable: you can only add data to it.

### 3. [How Git commands work](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1630972442712604682)

![How Git commands work](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqJgykFaUAArpJE?format=jpg&name=large)

- To begin with, it's essential to identify where our code is stored. The common assumption is that there are only two locations - one on a remote server like Github and the other on our local machine.

- However, this isn't entirely accurate. Git maintains three local storages on our machine, which means that our code can be found in four places:
    - Working directory: where we edit files
    - Staging area: a temporary location where files are kept for the next commit
    - Local repository: contains the code that has been committed
    - Remote repository: the remote server that stores the code

- Most Git commands primarily move files between these four locations.

> When we 𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐬 from one Git branch to another, we can use ‘git merge’ or ‘git rebase’. What are the differences?
> The diagram below shows how the two commands work.

𝐆𝐢𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞
- This creates a new commit G’ in the main branch. G’ ties the histories of both main and feature branches.
- Git merge is 𝐧𝐨𝐧-𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞. Neither the main nor the feature branch is changed.

𝐆𝐢𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞
- Git rebase moves the feature branch histories to the head of the main branch. It creates new commits E’, F’, and G’ for each commit in the feature branch.
- The benefit of rebase is that it has 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲.

> Rebase can be dangerous if “the golden rule of git rebase” is not followed.

- Never use it on public branches!
