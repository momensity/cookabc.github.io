### [What the differences between Open Source Licences?](https://twitter.com/BhosalePratim/status/1633141561692241923)

> Open Source licences make sure that the usage, modification, and distribution of software code is done lawfully while respecting the rights of the creator.
> 
> There are around 80 licences put together by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). They will majorly fall under the Permissive and Copyleft type of license. 
>
> The following are the most commonly used licences.

**1. MIT License:**
  
  This is one of the most widely used open-source licenses. It allows developers to modify and distribute software under the condition that the license is included. This license is often used for libraries and other small projects.

> eg: JQuery, Node.js, Ruby on Rails

**2. Apache License 2.0:**
  
  The Apache License is a permissive free software license similar to MIT in terms of distribution and modification. But the Apache license also includes a patent license which grants users the right to use any patent that the software covers.

> Tomcat, Kafka, Hadoop, Cassandra and many more famous softwares use the Apache license. 

_While permissive licenses give access to more modifications and distribution of software, Copyleft licenses require the derived software to also be licensed under the same terms._

**3. GPL(General Public License):**
   
   It is the first copyleft license. Under this license modified source code should have the same license as the original and the licensing header should be present on the source code. 

> Linux, GCC and VLC media player use GPL.

**4. Berkeley Source Distribution(BSD):**
  
  This license is similar to the MIT License, but includes a clause that prohibits the use of the software's name or the names of its contributors to endorse or promote products derived from the software.

> There are now multiple versions of BSD.
- PostgreSQL is licensed under BSD. 
- And many operating systems also use BSD.

**5. BSL(Business Source License):**
  
  BSL v.1.1 allows copying, modification, redistribution, non-commercial use, and commercial use in a non-production context. It allows the creator to govern commercialization terms of source code without compromising non-commercial deployments.
  
  This is a relatively new license and its adoption may still be limited compared to more established open-source licenses like the GPL, MIT, or Apache licenses.

> A lot of open source databases have adopted the BSL license.
