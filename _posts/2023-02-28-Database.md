### 1. [How do you decide which type of database to use?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1600528222390669315)

> There are hundreds or even thousands of databases available today, such as Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, MongoDB, S3, Ceph, etc. 
> How do you select the architecture for your system?

![which type of database to use](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjY38RdVUA0OAcp?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

- **Relational database.** Almost anything could be solved by them.
- **In-memory store.** Their speed and limited data size make them ideal for fast operations.
- **Time-series database.** Store and manage time-stamped data.
- **Graph database.** It is suitable for complex relationships between unstructured objects.
- **Document store.** They are good for large immutable data.
- **Wide column store.** They are usually used for big data, analytics, reporting, etc., which needs denormalized data.

### 2. [How to choose the right Database?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1519706088391602176)

> Data can be structured (SQL), semi-structured (JSON), and unstructured (Blob).
>
> Common DB categories:
- Relational
- Columnar
- Key-value
- In-memory
- Wide column
- Time Series
- Immutable ledger
- Geospatial
- Graph
- Document
- Text search
- Blob

### 3. [What is 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞-𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐃𝐁 (TSDB)?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1599801032061558784)

> How is it 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 from Relational DB? A TSDB is a database optimized for time series data.

![What is 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞-𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐃𝐁 (TSDB)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjOijrrVIAArinX?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

- From the users’ perspective, the data looks similar to the relational DB table. But behind the scenes, the weather table is stored in 4 TSMs (Time-Structured Merge Trees) in the format of [Measurement, Tag, Field Name].

- In this way, we can quickly aggregate and analyze data based on time and tags.

- Typical usage:
    - Trades and market data updates in a market
    - Server metrics
    - Application performance monitoring
    - Network data
    - Sensor data
    - Events
    - Clicks streams

### 4. [Why is PostgreSQL voted the 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1585296460072919040)

> The diagram shows the many use cases by PostgreSQL - one database that includes almost 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 developers need.

![Why is PostgreSQL voted the 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgAauZiUYAA4Wrn?format=jpg&name=large)

- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**

> We can use PostgreSQL for CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations.

- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**

> We can use PostgreSQL for analytical processing. PostgreSQL is based on 𝐇𝐓𝐀𝐏 (Hybrid transactional/analytical processing) architecture, so it can handle both OLTP and OLAP well.

- **FDW (Foreign Data Wrapper)**

> A FDW is an extension available in PostgreSQL that allows us to access a table or schema in one database from another.

- **Streaming**

> PipelineDB is a PostgreSQL extension for high-performance time-series aggregation, designed to power real-time reporting and analytics applications.

- **Geospatial**

> PostGIS is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects, allowing location queries to be run in SQL.

- **Time Series**

> Timescale extends PostgreSQL for time series and analytics. For example, developers can combine relentless streams of financial and tick data with other business data to build new apps and uncover unique insights.

- **Distributed Tables**

> CitusData scales Postgres by distributing data & queries.

### 5. [8 Key Data Structures That Power Modern Databases](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1617564098820182018)

> Data Structures That Power Databases. Which one should we pick? 
> 
> The answer will vary depending on your use case.
> Data can be indexed in memory or on disk. Similarly, data formats vary, such as numbers, strings, geographic coordinates, etc. 
> The system might be write-heavy or read-heavy.
> All of these factors affect your choice of database index format.
>
> The following are some of the most popular data structures used for indexing data: 

![8 Key Data Structures That Power Modern Databases](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnK99jjakAAyo6l?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

- **Skiplist**: a common in-memory index type. Used in Redis
- **Hash index**: a very common implementation of the “Map” data structure (or “Collection”)
- **SSTable**: immutable on-disk “Map” implementation
- **LSM tree**: Skiplist + SSTable. High write throughput
- **B-tree**: disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performance
- **Inverted index**: used for document indexing. Used in Lucene
- **Suffix tree**: for string pattern search
- **R-tree**: multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor

### 6. [What are database isolation levels?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1526234911178272768)

> Database isolation allows a transaction to execute as if there are no other concurrently running transactions.
>
> The diagram below illustrates four isolation levels.

![What are database isolation levels](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FS5Gj0HVIAECt8w?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

- **Serializalble**: This is the highest isolation level. Concurrent transactions are guaranteed to be executed in sequence.
- **Repeatable Read**: Data read during the transaction stays the same as the transaction starts.
- **Read Committed**: Data modification can only be read after the transaction is committed
- **Read Uncommitted**: The data modification can be read by other transactions before a transaction is committed

> The isolation is guaranteed by MVCC(Multi-Version Consistency Control) and locks

1. There are two hidden columns for each row: `transaction_id` and `roll_pointer`. When transaction A starts, a new Read View with `transaction_id=201` is created. Shortly afterward, transaction B starts, and a new Read View with `transaction_id=202` is created.
2. Now transaction A modifies the balance to 200, a new row of the log is created, and the `roll_pointer` points to the old row.
3. Before transaction A commits, transaction B reads the balance data. Transaction B finds that `transaction_id 201` is not committed, it reads the next committed record(`transaction_id=200`).
4. Even when transaction A commits, transaction B still reads data based on the Read View created when transaction B starts. So transaction B always reads the data with `balance=100`.

### 7. [How does CDC work?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1527318907786186753)

> Data stored in the database could be interesting to many other data systems, such as analytics, AI, etc. 
> If we have thousands of data systems, do we have to write thousands of converters?
>
> Change data capture (CDC) is a process that can solve the problem. This is how CDC works:

![How does CDC work](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTIgc3KUUAIdj0M?format=jpg&name=large)

1. Data is written to the database normally.
2. Database uses the transaction log to record the modifications.
3. CDC software uses the source connector to connect to the database and reads the transaction log.
4. The source connector publishes the log to the message queue.
5. CDC software uses its sink connector to consume the log.
6. The sink connector writes the log content to the destination.

> All these operations except step 1 are transparent to the user. Popular CDC solutions, such as Debezium, have connectors for most databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, Oracle, etc.
> 
> We only need to set up the CDC link between two databases and the data will automatically flow to the destination.
