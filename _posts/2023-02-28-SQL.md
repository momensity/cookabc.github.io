- Step 1 - A SQL statement is sent to the database via a transport layer protocol (e.g.TCP).
- Step 2 - The SQL statement is sent to the command parser, where it goes through syntactic and semantic analysis, and a query tree is generated afterward.
- Step 3 - The query tree is sent to the optimizer. The optimizer creates an execution plan.
- Step 4 - The execution plan is sent to the executor. The executor retrieves data from the execution.
- Step 5 - Access methods provide the data fetching logic required for execution
- Step 6 - Access methods decide whether the SQL statement is read-only. If the query is read-only (SELECT statement), it is passed to the buffer manager for further processing. The buffer manager looks for the data in the cache or data files.
- Step 7 - If the statement is an UPDATE or INSERT, it is passed to the transaction manager for further processing.
- Step 8 - During a transaction, the data is in lock mode. This is guaranteed by the lock manager. It also ensures the transaction’s ACID properties.

### 2. [What is Distributed SQL?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1542531936706392064)

> Google Spanner popularized the term Distributed SQL database in 2012. 
> Distributed SQL databases 𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 to multiple nodes and are 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭.
>
> 𝐏𝐚𝐱𝐨𝐬 𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐟𝐭 algorithms are commonly used to achieve consensus across multiple nodes.
> Examples of Distributed SQL databases: Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, etc.

**Terms:**
> - OLTP = Online transactional processing
> - OLAP = Online analytical processing
> - HTAP = Hybrid transaction/analytical processing

1. The life of an **OLTP** query (marked with 𝐛𝐥𝐮𝐞 sequence numbers):
- Step 1. A client sends a MySQL query and the query is interpreted by TiDB, a stateless layer that interprets the MySQL protocol.
- Step 2: TiDB requests data mapping/placement information from the PD.
- Step 3: PD responds with data mapping/ placement instructions & timestamp.
- Step 4: TiDB executes queries on TiKV servers (row-based storage)
- Step 5, 6: Query results are sent back to the client

2. The life of a complex **OLAP** query: follow the 𝐲𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 sequence numbers
