### 1. [How is a SQL statement executed?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1559566919585259520)

> The diagram below shows the process. 
> Note that the architectures for different databases are different, the diagram demonstrates some common designs.

- Step 1 - A SQL statement is sent to the database via a transport layer protocol (e.g.TCP).
- Step 2 - The SQL statement is sent to the command parser, where it goes through syntactic and semantic analysis, and a query tree is generated afterward.
- Step 3 - The query tree is sent to the optimizer. The optimizer creates an execution plan.
- Step 4 - The execution plan is sent to the executor. The executor retrieves data from the execution.
- Step 5 - Access methods provide the data fetching logic required for execution
- Step 6 - Access methods decide whether the SQL statement is read-only. If the query is read-only (SELECT statement), it is passed to the buffer manager for further processing. The buffer manager looks for the data in the cache or data files.
- Step 7 - If the statement is an UPDATE or INSERT, it is passed to the transaction manager for further processing.
- Step 8 - During a transaction, the data is in lock mode. This is guaranteed by the lock manager. It also ensures the transaction’s ACID properties.

### 2. [SQL Query Execution Order](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1633509145335988224)

> Want to know the secret to optimizing your SQL queries? Understanding the execution order is key.

**1. SQL statements are executed by the database system in several steps, including:**
- Parsing the SQL statement and checking its validity
- Transforming the SQL into an internal representation, such as relational algebra
- Optimizing the internal representation and creating an execution plan that utilizes index information
- Executing the plan and returning the results

**2. The execution of SQL is highly complex and involves many considerations, such as:**
- The use of indexes and caches
- The order of table joins
- Concurrency control
- Transaction management

**3. For example:**
- The "now()" function in SQL, as used in the statement "SELECT NOW() + 1;", is evaluated during the optimization and execution plan creation step where the function is replaced with the current date and time value before creating the execution plan.

### 3. [How does a relational database execute SQL statements and prepared statements](https://vladmihalcea.com/relational-database-sql-prepared-statements/)

> The main database modules responsible for processing a SQL statement are:
- the `Parser` reads the SQL query and breaks it down into a parse tree, which represents the syntactic structure of the query.
- the `Optimizer` takes the parse tree and creates an execution plan, which determines how the query should be executed to produce the desired results.
- the `Executor` then executes the query based on the execution plan, fetching data from the database and returning the results to the user or application.

#### Why are prepared statements developed?
> 1. ***Performance optimization***: Prepared statements can improve query performance by reducing the overhead of query parsing and optimization.
> 2. ***Security***: Prepared statements protect against SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping any user-supplied input.
> 3. ***Reusability***: Prepared statements can be reused multiple times with different parameter values, reducing the need to send the same query repeatedly to the database.
> 4. ***Maintainability***: Prepared statements can make it easier to modify SQL queries, as changes only need to be made in one place (the prepared statement) rather than in multiple places throughout the code.
> 5. ***Portability***: Prepared statements can be used with different database systems and programming languages, providing a consistent approach to handling SQL queries.
>
> This diagram illustrates how a prepared statement is executed on the server-side.

1. The client application sends a request to the database server with the prepared statement's identifier and the parameter values.
2. The database server looks up the prepared statement in its cache based on the identifier.
3. If the prepared statement is found in the cache, the server retrieves its execution plan and substitutes the parameter values.
4. If the prepared statement is not found in the cache, the server parses and compiles the query, creates an execution plan, and stores the plan in the cache for future use.
5. The server executes the query with the substituted parameter values and returns the results to the client application.

### 4. [What is Distributed SQL?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1542531936706392064)

> Google Spanner popularized the term Distributed SQL database in 2012. 
> Distributed SQL databases 𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 to multiple nodes and are 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭.
>
> 𝐏𝐚𝐱𝐨𝐬 𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐟𝐭 algorithms are commonly used to achieve consensus across multiple nodes.
> Examples of Distributed SQL databases: Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, etc.

**Terms:**
> - OLTP = Online transactional processing
> - OLAP = Online analytical processing
> - HTAP = Hybrid transaction/analytical processing

1. The life of an **OLTP** query (marked with 𝐛𝐥𝐮𝐞 sequence numbers):
- Step 1. A client sends a MySQL query and the query is interpreted by TiDB, a stateless layer that interprets the MySQL protocol.
- Step 2: TiDB requests data mapping/placement information from the PD.
- Step 3: PD responds with data mapping/ placement instructions & timestamp.
- Step 4: TiDB executes queries on TiKV servers (row-based storage)
- Step 5, 6: Query results are sent back to the client

2. The life of a complex **OLAP** query: follow the 𝐲𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 sequence numbers
