**A forward proxy is a server that sits between user devices and the internet. It is good for:**
- Protect clients
- Avoid browsing restrictions
- Block access to certain content


**A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from the client, forwards the request to web servers, and returns the results to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request. It is good for:**
- Protect servers
- Load balancing
- Cache static contents
- Encrypt and decrypt SSL communications
