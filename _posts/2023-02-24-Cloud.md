### 1. [What is cloud-native?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1607417223840411652)

> Below is a diagram showing the evolution of architecture and processes since the 1980s.

![What is cloud-native](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fk6xcSnaEAA-qBg?format=jpg&name=large)

Cloud-native includes 4 aspects:

**1. Development process**
> This has progressed from waterfall to agile to DevOps.

**2. Application architecture**
> The architecture has gone from monolithic to microservices. Each service is designed to be small, adaptive to the limited resources in cloud containers.

**3. Deployment & packaging**
> The applications used to be deployed on physical servers. Then around 2000, the apps not sensitive to latency were usually deployed on virtual servers. With cloud-native, apps are packaged into docker images and deployed in containers

**4. Application infrastructure**
> The applications are massively deployed on cloud infrastructure instead of self-hosted servers.

### 2. [What tech stack is commonly used for microservices?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1605965563410272263)

> Below you will find a diagram showing the microservice tech stack, both for the development phase and for production.

- **𝐏𝐫𝐞-𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧**

> - Define API - This establishes a contract between frontend and backend. We can use Postman or OpenAPI for this.
> - Development - Node.js or react is popular for frontend development, and java/python/go for backend development. Also, we need to change the configurations in the API gateway according to API definitions.
> - Continuous Integration - JUnit and Jenkins for automated testing. The code is packaged into a Docker image and deployed as microservices.

- **𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧**

> - NGinx is a common choice for load balancers. Cloudflare provides CDN (Content Delivery Network).
> - API Gateway - We can use spring boot for the gateway, and use Eureka/Zookeeper for service discovery.
> - The microservices are deployed on clouds. We have options among AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google GCP.
> - Cache and Full-text Search - Redis is a common choice for caching key-value pairs. ElasticSearch is used for full-text search.
> - Communications - For services to talk to each other, we can use messaging infra Kafka or RPC.
> - Persistence - We can use MySQL or PostgreSQL for a relational database, and Amazon S3 for object store. We can also use Cassandra for the wide-column store if necessary.
> - Management & Monitoring - To manage so many microservices, the common Ops tools include Prometheus, Elastic Stack, and Kubernetes.

### 3. [How to Deploy Services?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1590384986011549696)

> Deploying or upgrading services is risky. The diagram below illustrates the common ones.

![How to Deploy Services](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhIutwXVsAEL2ch?format=jpg&name=large)

**1. 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> In this model, we deploy new changes to multiple services simultaneously. This approach is easy to implement. But since all the services are upgraded at the same time, it is hard to manage, test dependencies, and rollback.

**2. 𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞-𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> With blue-green deployment, we have two identical environments: one is staging (blue) and the other is production (green). The staging environment is one version ahead of production.
> 
> Once testing is done in the staging environment, user traffic is switched to the staging environment, and the staging becomes the production. This deployment strategy is simple to perform rollback, but having two identical production quality environments could be expensive.

**3. 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> A canary deployment upgrades services gradually, each time to a subset of users. It is cheaper than blue-green deployment and easy to perform rollback. However, since there is no staging environment, we have to test on production.
>
> This process is more complicated because we need to monitor the canary while gradually migrating more and more users away from the old version.

**4. 𝐀/𝐁 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭**
> In the A/B test, different versions of services run in production simultaneously. Each version runs an “experiment” for a subset of users. A/B test is a cheap method to test new features in production.
>
> We need to control the deployment process in case some features are pushed to users by accident.

> The diagram below shows several common 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬.

**1. 𝐁𝐢𝐠 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> Big Bang Deployment is quite straightforward, where we roll out a new version in one go with service downtime. 
> We roll back to the previous version if the deployment fails.
>
> 💡 No downtime ❌
>
> 💡 Targeted users ❌

**2. 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> Rolling Deployment applies phased deployment compared with big bang deployment. 
> The whole plant is upgraded one by one over a period of time.
>
> 💡 No downtime ✅
> 
> 💡 Targeted users ❌

**3. 𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞-𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> In blue-green deployment, two environments are deployed in production simultaneously.
> Once the green environment passes the tests, the load balancer switches users to it.
> 
> 💡 No downtime ✅
> 
> 💡 Targeted users ❌

**4. 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭**
> With canary deployment, only a small portion of instances are upgraded with the new version, once all the tests pass, a portion of users are routed to canary instances.
> 
> 💡 No downtime ✅
> 
> 💡 Targeted users ❌

**5. 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐨𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞**
> With the feature toggle, A small portion of users with a specific flag go through the code of the new feature, while other users go through normal code.
> 
> 💡 No downtime ✅
> 
> 💡 Targeted users ✅

> The diagram below shows why 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 and 𝐥𝐨𝐰-𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 applications should not use microservice architecture.

![𝐈𝐬 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmC3szwaEAI63Ro?format=jpg&name=medium)

> There are some common features of these applications, which make them choose monolithic architecture:

#### 1. These applications are very 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲-𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞. We cannot separate the services into different processes because the network latency is unbearable.
> - For real-time gaming, the latency should be at the milli-second level.
> - For low-latency trading, the latency should be at the micro-second level.

#### 2. Microservice architecture is usually 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬, and the states are persisted in the database. Real-time gaming and low-latency trading need to 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 for quick updates.
> For example, when a character is injured in a game, we don’t want to see the update 3 seconds later. This kind of user experience can kill a game.

#### 3. Real-time gaming and low-latency trading need to talk to the server in high frequency, and the requests need to go to the same running instance. So 𝐰𝐞𝐛 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭 connections and 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐲 𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 are needed.

> So microservice architecture is designed to solve problems for certain domains. We need to think about “why” when designing applications.
