### 1. [Retry patterns](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/retry-patterns-episode-9?s=r)

> Some failures are transient, which makes it a good candidate to retry the request.
>
> If an application detects a failure when it tries an operation, it can handle the failure using the following strategies:

![Retry patterns](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8909aa28-5822-4347-862b-000bd334d8b6_2403x1140.jpeg)

- ***Cancel***: the client can cancel the request. 
- ***Immediate retry***: client immediately resends a request.
- ***Fixed intervals***: wait a fixed amount of time between the time of the failed payment and a new retry attempt.
- ***Incremental intervals***: client waits for a short time for the first retry, and then incrementally increases the time for subsequent retries.
- ***Exponential backoff***: double the waiting time between retries after each failed retry. For example, when a request fails for the first time, we retry after 1 second; if it fails a second time, we wait 2 seconds before the next retry; if it fails a third time, we wait 4 seconds before another retry.
- ***Exponential backoff with jitter***: if all the failed calls back off at the same time, they cause contention or overload again when they retry. Jitter adds some amount of randomness to the backoff to spread the retries.

**Issues**

- Retry is not perfect. It can cause issues such as overloading the system, executing the same operation multiple times, and amplifying a problem by creating a storm of requests.
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers patterns are commonly used to limit the load and avoid service overload.

### 2. [Read replica pattern](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/read-replica-pattern?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FRetry%2520patterns&utm_medium=reader2)

> In this setup, all data-modifying commands like insert, delete, or update are sent to the primary DB and reads are sent to read replicas.
> 
> The diagram below illustrates the setup: 

![Read replica pattern](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310babaa-4a78-47ec-a925-125ab9b19a71_1536x1572.png)

1. When Alice places an order on amazon.com, the request is sent to Order Service. 
2. Order Service creates a record about the order in the primary DB (write). Data is replicated to two replicas.
3. Alice views the order details. Data is served from a replica (read).
4. Alice views the recent order history. Data is served from a replica (read).

There is one major problem in this setup: ***replication lag***.

- Under certain circumstances (network delay, server overload, etc.), data in replicas might be seconds or even minutes behind. In this case, if Alice immediately checks the order status (query is served by the replica) after the order is placed, she might not see the order at all. This leaves Alice confused. In this case, we need ‚Äúread-after-write‚Äù consistency.

- Possible solutions to mitigate this problem:
1. Latency sensitive reads are sent to the primary database.
2. Reads that immediately follow writes are routed to the primary database.
3. A relational DB generally provides a way to check if a replica is caught up with the primary. If data is up to date, query the replica. Otherwise fail the read request or read from the primary.

### 3. [Event Sourcing](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1539999422485913600)

> The diagram below shows the comparison of a normal CRUD system design with an event sourcing system design. 
> We use an e-commerce system that can place orders and pay for the orders to demonstrate how event sourcing works.
>
> The event sourcing paradigm is used to design a system with determinism.
> This changes the philosophy of normal system designs.

![Event Sourcing](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FV8tT04VUAE0ms_?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Let's look at the steps in detail.

**1. Non-Event Sourcing**

- Steps 1 and 2: Bob wants to buy a product. The order is created and inserted into the database.
- Steps 3 and 4: Bob wants to change the quantity from 5 to 6. The order is modified with a new state.
- Steps 5 and 6: Bob pays $60 for the order. The order is complete and the state is Paid.
- Steps 7 and 8: Bob queries the latest order state. Query service retrieves the state from the database.

**2. Event Sourcing**

- Steps 1 and 2: Bob wants to buy a product. A NewOrderEvent is created, sequenced and stored in the event store with eventID=2001.
- Steps 3 and 4: Bob wants to change the quantity from 5 to 6. A ModifyOrderEvent is created, sequenced, and persisted in the event store with eventID=2002.
- Steps 5 and 6: Bob pays $60 for the order. An OrderPaymentEvent is created, sequenced, and stored in the event store with eventID=2003. Notice the different event types have different event attributes.
- Step 7: OrderView listens on the events published from the event store, and builds the latest state for the orders. Although OrderView receives 3 events, it applies the events one by one and keeps the latest state.
- Step 8: Bob queries the order state from OrderService, which then queries OrderView. OrderView can be in memory or cache and does not need to be persisted, because it can be recovered from the event store.

### 4. [Permission System](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1570077278104875008)

> The diagram below lists 5 common ways. üëá

![Permission System](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcoI9DLaAAACz7k?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

**1. ACL (Access Control List)**
> ACL is a list of rules that specifies which users are granted or denied access to a particular resource.
> - Pros: Easy to understand.
> - Cons: error-prone, maintenance cost is high

**2. DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**
> It grants or restricts object access via an access policy determined by an object's owner group.
> - Pros: Easy and flexible. Linux file system supports DAC.
> - Cons: Scattered permission control, too much power for the object‚Äôs owner group

**3. MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**
> Both resource owners and resources have classification labels. Different labels are granted with different permissions.
> - Pros: strict and straightforward.
> - Cons: not flexible.

**4. ABAC (Attribute-based access control)**
> Evaluate permissions based on attributes of the Resource owner, Action, Resource, and Environment.
> - Pros: flexible
> - Cons: the rules can be complicated, and the implementation is hard. It is not commonly used.

**5. RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**
> Evaluate permissions based on roles
> - Pros: flexible in assigning roles.
