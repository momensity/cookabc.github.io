### 1. [Design a message queue](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1542882527110541312)

> Assuming in a system design interview, you are asked to design a distributed message queue.
> The following requirements are given:
1. Producers send messages
2. Consumers consume messages
3. Messages can be consumed repeatedly or only once
>
> The diagram below shows the naive design.

>
***starvation-free:***
Thread Starvation means a thread cannot acquire access to certain shared resources and cannot proceed. 
Starvation-free means this situation does not occur.
>
***wait-free:***
All threads can complete the tasks within a finite number of steps.

**1. Blocking Algorithm**
- The blocking algorithm uses locks. Thread A acquires the lock first, and Thread B might wait for arbitrary lengthy periods if Thread A gets suspended while holding the lock. This algorithm may cause Thread B to starve.

**2. Non-blocking Algorithm**
- The non-blocking algorithm allows Thread A to access the queue, but Thread A must complete a task in a certain number of steps. Other threads like Thread B may still starve due to the rejections.

> This is the main 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 between blocking and non-blocking algorithms: 
> - The blocking algorithm blocks Thread B until the lock is released. 
> - The non-blocking algorithm notifies Thread B that access is rejected.

**3.Non-Blocking Queue Implementation**
> We can use Compare and Swap (CAS) to implement a non-blocking queue. The diagram below illustrates the algorithm.

1. ***No thread suspension***. Thread B can get a response immediately and then decide what to do next. In this way, the thread latency is greatly reduced.
2. ***No deadlocks***. Threads A and B do not wait for the lock to release, meaning that there is no possibility of a deadlock occurring.
