### 1. [How is email delivered?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1537462742025576449)

> Email functions in a similar way to traditional ‘snail’ mail. 
> The terminology changes because it is an internet-based solution, but the fundamentals are the same:

1. Instead of putting mail in a mailbox, the sender pushes an email to the Sender Mail Server using `MUA` (mail user agent) such as `Outlook` or `Gmail`.
2. Instead of using postal offices to relay mail, `MTA` (mail transmission agent) relays the email. It communicates via the `SMTP` protocol.
3. The email is received by the Receiver Mail Server. It stores the email to the Mailbox by using `MDA` (mail delivery agent).
4. The receiver uses `MUA` to retrieve the email using the `POP3/IMAP` protocol.

> In this post, we will take a look at what happens when Alice sends an 𝐄𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐥 to Bob.

1. Alice logs in to her `Outlook` client, composes an email, and presses “send”. The email is sent to the `Outlook` mail server. The communication protocol between the `Outlook` client and mail server is `SMTP`.

2. `Outlook` mail server queries the `DNS` (not shown in the diagram) to find the address of the recipient’s `SMTP` server. In this case, it is `Gmail`’s `SMTP` server. Next, it transfers the email to the `Gmail` mail server. The communication protocol between the mail servers is `SMTP`.

3. The `Gmail` server stores the email and makes it available to Bob, the recipient.

4. `Gmail` client fetches new emails through the `IMAP/POP` server when Bob logs in to `Gmail`.


> If you are unfamiliar with email protocols, here is a short summary:

***SMTP***: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the standard protocol for sending emails from one mail server to another.

***POP***: Post Office Protocol (POP) is a standard mail protocol to receive and download emails from a remote mail server to a local email client. 
- Once emails are downloaded to your computer or phone, they are deleted from the email server, which means you can only access emails on one computer or phone.
- The details of POP are covered in RFC 1939. POP requires mail clients to download the entire email. This can take a long time if an email contains a large attachment.

***IMAP***: Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) is also a standard mail protocol for receiving emails for a local email client. 
- When you read an email, you are connected to an external mail server, and data is transferred to your local device.
- IMAP only downloads a message when you click it, and emails are not deleted from mail servers, meaning that you can access emails from multiple devices. 
- IMAP is the most widely used protocol for individual email accounts.
