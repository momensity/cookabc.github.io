### 2. [How to design a secure web API access for you website?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1514256018187816965)

> When we open web API access to users, we need to make sure each API call is authenticated. 
> This means the user must be who they claim to be.
>
> In this post, we explore two common ways:
> 1. Token based authentication
> 2. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) authentication
> 
> The diagram below illustrates how they work.

- Step 1 - the user enters their password into the client, and the client sends the password to the Authentication Server.
- Step 2 - the Authentication Server authenticates the credentials and generates a token with an expiry time.
- Steps 3 and 4 - now the client can send requests to access server resources with the token in the HTTP header. This access is valid until the token expires.

> This mechanism generates a Message Authentication Code (signature) by using a hash function (SHA256 or MD5).

- Steps 1 and 2 - the server generates two keys, one is Public APP ID (public key) and the other one is API Key (private key).
- Step 3 - we now generate a HMAC signature on the client side (hmac A). This signature is generated with a set of attributes listed in the diagram.
- Step 4 - the client sends requests to access server resources with hmac A in the HTTP header.
- Step 5 - the server receives the request which contains the request data and the authentication header. It extracts the necessary attributes from the request and uses the API key that’s stored on the server side to generate a signature (hmac B.)
- Steps 6 and 7 - the server compares hmac A (generated on the client side) and hmac B (generated on the server side). If they are matched, the requested resource will be returned to the client.

### 3. [What does API gateway do?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1567177071725793283)

> The diagram below shows the detail.

![API gateway](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fb-7PINaMAMwGse?format=jpg&name=large)

- Step 1 - The client sends an HTTP request to the API gateway.
- Step 2 - The API gateway parses and validates the attributes in the HTTP request.
- Step 3 - The API gateway performs whitelist or blacklist checks.
- Step 4 - The API gateway talks to an identity provider for authentication and authorization.
- Step 5 - The rate limiting rules are applied to the request. If it is over the limit, the request is rejected.
- Steps 6 and 7 - Now that the request has passed basic checks, the API gateway finds the relevant service to route to by path matching.
- Step 8 - The API gateway transforms the request into the appropriate protocol and sends it to backend microservices.
- Steps 9-12: The API gateway can handle errors properly, and deals with faults if the error takes a longer time to recover (circuit break). It can also leverage ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana) stack for logging and monitoring. We sometimes cache data in the API gateway.

### 4. [How does 𝐠𝐑𝐏𝐂 work?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1589661228502171649)

> RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is called “𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐞” because it enables communications between remote services when services are deployed to different servers. 
> From the user’s point of view, it acts like a local function call.
>
> The diagram below illustrates the overall data flow for 𝐠𝐑𝐏𝐂.

- Step 1: A REST call is made from the client. The request body is usually in JSON format.
- Steps 2 - 4: The order service (gRPC client) receives the REST call, transforms it, and makes an RPC call to the payment service. gPRC encodes the 𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐛 into a binary format and sends it to the low-level transport layer.
- Step 5: gRPC sends the packets over the network via HTTP2. Because of binary encoding and network optimizations, gRPC is said to be 5X faster than JSON.
- Steps 6 - 8: The payment service (gRPC server) receives the packets from the network, decodes them, and invokes the server application.
- Steps 9 - 11: The result is returned from the server application, and gets encoded and sent to the transport layer.
- Steps 12 - 14: The order service receives the packets, decodes them, and sends the result to the client application.

### 5. [What is GraphQL?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1567539463072673792)

> The diagram below shows the quick comparison between REST and GraphQL.

![What is GraphQL](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcEE056aIAUU7YS?format=jpg&name=large)

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Meta. It provides a complete description of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.
- GraphQL servers sit in between the client and the backend services.
- GraphQL can aggregate multiple REST requests into one query. GraphQL server organizes the resources in a graph.
- GraphQL supports queries, mutations (applying data modifications to resources), and subscriptions (receiving notifications on schema modifications).

> Over time, different API architectural styles are released. Each of them has its own patterns of standardizing data exchange.
