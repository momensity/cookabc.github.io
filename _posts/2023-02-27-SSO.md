### 1. [How does SSO work?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1523691173327507456)

> What is SSO (Single Sign-On)?
> Basically, Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication scheme. It allows a user to log in to different systems using a single ID.
>
> The diagram below illustrates how SSO works.

- Step 1: A user visits Gmail, or any email service. Gmail finds the user is not logged in and so redirects them to the SSO authentication server, which also finds the user is not logged in. As a result, the user is redirected to the SSO login page, where they enter their login credentials.

- Steps 2-3: The SSO authentication server validates the credentials, creates the global session for the user, and creates a token.

- Steps 4-7: Gmail validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the Gmail system, and returns “valid.” Gmail returns the protected resource to the user.

- Step 8: From Gmail, the user navigates to another Google-owned website, for example, YouTube.

- Steps 9-10: YouTube finds the user is not logged in, and then requests authentication. The SSO authentication server finds the user is already logged in and returns the token.

- Step 11-14: YouTube validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the YouTube system, and returns “valid.” YouTube returns the protected resource to the user.

### 2. [Session, cookie, JWT, token, SSO, and OAuth 2.0](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1595455518583029764)

> These terms are all related to user identity management. 
> When you log into a website, you declare who you are (identification). Your identity is verified (authentication), and you are granted the necessary permissions (authorization).
> Many solutions have been proposed in the past, and the list keeps growing.
>
> From simple to complex, here is my understanding of user identity management:

![Session, cookie, JWT, token, SSO, and OAuth 2.0](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiQyVXJUAAgoqvR?format=jpg&name=large)

- **WWW-Authenticate is the most basic method.** You are asked for the username and password by the browser. As a result of the inability to control the login life cycle, it is seldom used today.

- **A finer control over the login life cycle is session-cookie.** The server maintains session storage, and the browser keeps the ID of the session. A cookie usually only works with browsers and is not mobile app friendly.

- **To address the compatibility issue, the token can be used.** The client sends the token to the server, and the server validates the token. The downside is the token needs to be encrypted and decrypted, which may be time-consuming.

- **JWT is a standard way of representing tokens.** This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Since JWT contains the signature, there is no need to save session information on the server side.

- **By using SSO (single sign-on),** you can sign on only once and log in to multiple websites. It uses CAS (central authentication service) to maintain cross-site information

- **By using OAuth 2.0,** you can authorize one website to access your information on another website
